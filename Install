Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

I use the !Boot application as provided by !Browse and Java CD's and the
modules appear to work from the following directories.
PollWord module should be copied to the !System.modules directory
and AsyncSock module to !System.modules.network directory. If your setup is
different then you may need to modify the !Run file inside !Inetd.

!SysLog should have been seen/booted before !Inetd is run. So needs to be
somewhere in the bootup sequence of your machine.

I use INetDB as my resolver. Either INetDB or the Acorn/ANT Resolver has to
be loaded before.

Otherwise, all should be OK, happy serving!
